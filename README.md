# Rsearch and Reflection Journal
Research and Reflection Journal for DGL 104 course

## Week 8 (Feb. 25)

This week was a mix of getting back to some core development principles and starting to look outward toward how users actually experience the things we build.

I started by accepting the GitHub classroom invite and getting my repository up and running. After that, I spent time reviewing the mid-semester materials, which revisited important coding habits like writing good documentation, debugging properly, refactoring code, and testing thoroughly. It was a solid reminder that no matter how much we build, the basics still matter.

One of the highlights this week was the lecture on user stories and functional requirements. It really helped me see development in a new way. Instead of just thinking about code, I was encouraged to step into the shoes of users and think about what they actually need. It’s a small shift, but it made me realize that even simple apps solve real problems.

For the required activity, I had to research a new programming language. I chose Lua – something I had heard about before but never really explored. Turns out, it’s quite popular in game development (Roblox, for example) and is also used in embedded systems. I found some useful resources, like the official [Lua.org](https://www.lua.org/) site for documentation, [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/) for managing Lua packages, and [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/), which helps make Lua faster. It’s a pretty lightweight language, and I can see why it’s valued for games and embedded systems.

We also got to write user stories based on WhatsApp. I came up with:
- *"As a user, I can quickly send a text message from my contact list."*
- *"As a user, I can add new contacts directly from the message screen."*

Thinking through the acceptance criteria made me realize how much thought goes into simple actions like adding a contact – it’s easy to overlook how much UX design is at play behind the scenes.

Another key decision I made this week was choosing Javascript for my Application Development Project. After two semesters working with it and using it in some personal projects, I feel comfortable but also curious to dive deeper. I’m hoping to explore more advanced Javascript features and strengthen my web app development skills.

Lastly, I took some time on GitHub to star projects and topics related to Javascript and web app dev in general. It was cool to see how many open-source tools are out there, and it gave me a few ideas for how I might approach the project.

### Reflection
Overall, this week felt like a nice bridge between technical basics and user-centered thinking. The conversations on Slack were a bonus too – reading what others shared about languages like Haskell and Processing expanded my view a bit. It’s easy to get locked into the tools you know, but this week reminded me that there’s always more out there to learn.
